# Filtered Block
Chrome extension to block suggested and sponsored cards from Facebook feeds. 
Could be repurposed for other stuff too, like LinkedIn polls.

## Installation
- Navigate to Chrome->Extensions
- Enable Developer mode
- Click on `Load unpacked` and point it to the root of this repo
- Navigate to Facebook and watch the magic happen

## Caveats
Only works if Facebook is set to english. Currently relies on very specific number of spans (a bit of black magic since Facebook devs seem to be pretty sneaky and make our job hard). This can change in the future.
